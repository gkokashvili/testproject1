I didn't used any kind of VueJS or any front codings tried doing everything in Laravel as requested. </br></br>
I have created uplaod Form for XML files to import employes and also create Departaments from that file if departament of employe doesnt exists already if exists in this case we are creating new department and binding it to employe.</br></br>
This is how XML file should be structured https://easyupload.io/mhewel you can download and use this file for testing.</br></br>
I have not wasted any time on styling and such things as U want to know my Laravel knowledge in this test.</br></br>
